      "\n",
      "In today's world, we are drowning in data. Every click, transaction, sensor reading, and social media post generates vast amounts of information. Traditional methods of analysis (like simple spreadsheets or basic queries) are insufficient to make sense of this deluge. Data Mining provides the tools and techniques to:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Extract Value:** Turn raw data into actionable intelligence.\n",
      "2.  **Discover Hidden Patterns:** Uncover relationships and trends that human intuition or simple queries would miss.\n",
      "3.  **Predict Future Outcomes:** Forecast trends, identify risks, and anticipate customer behavior.\n",
      "4.  **Understand Complex Systems:** Gain deeper insights into customer segments, market dynamics, biological processes, or operational efficiencies.\n",
      "5.  **Automate Decision-Making:** Build models that can make predictions or recommendations without constant human intervention.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Components and Phases of the Data Mining Process (Often following CRISP-DM methodology)\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Business Understanding:** This is the most crucial first step. What problem are we trying to solve? What question are we trying to answer? What is the objective? (e.g., Reduce customer churn, detect fraud, optimize marketing campaigns).\n",
      "2.  **Data Understanding:** What data do we have available? What is its quality? Is it relevant to the problem? This involves initial exploration, visualization, and identifying data sources.\n",
      "3.  **Data Preparation (Pre-processing):** Often the most time-consuming phase (60-80% of the effort). This involves:\n",
      "    *   **Cleaning:** Handling missing values, correcting errors, removing duplicates.\n",
      "    *   **Transformation:** Normalizing data, aggregating, creating new features (feature engineering).\n",
      "    *   **Integration:** Combining data from multiple sources.\n",
      "    *   **Reduction:** Reducing the number of variables or observations while preserving important information.\n",
      "4.  **Modeling:** This is where the \"mining\" happens. Various algorithms are applied to the prepared data to find patterns.\n",
      "5.  **Evaluation:** Assessing the quality and validity of the discovered patterns and models. Are they accurate? Are they robust? Do they meet the business objectives?\n",
      "6.  **Deployment:** Putting the model into practice. This could mean integrating it into an existing system, generating reports, or using its predictions to drive real-time decisions.\n",

      "\n",
      "Data Mining employs a variety of techniques, each suited for different types of problems:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Classification:** Categorizing data into predefined classes.\n",
      "    *   *Example:* Predicting if an email is spam or not spam; classifying a customer as high-risk or low-risk for loan default.\n",
      "2.  **Regression:** Predicting a continuous numerical value.\n",
      "    *   *Example:* Forecasting house prices based on features; predicting a company's sales for the next quarter.\n",
      "3.  **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points together without prior knowledge of the groups.\n",
      "    *   *Example:* Segmenting customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior; identifying different types of galaxies in astronomical data.\n",
      "4.  **Association Rule Mining:** Discovering relationships between variables in large databases.\n",
      "    *   *Example:* \"Market Basket Analysis\" – if a customer buys product A and product B, they are likely to buy product C (e.g., \"People who buy diapers often buy beer\").\n",
      "5.  **Anomaly/Outlier Detection:** Identifying rare items, events, or observations that deviate significantly from the majority of the data.\n",
      "    *   *Example:* Detecting fraudulent credit card transactions; identifying unusual network intrusions.\n",
      "6.  **Sequential Pattern Mining:** Discovering patterns that occur in a specific order over time.\n",
      "    *   *Example:* Analyzing customer clickstreams on a website to understand navigation paths; predicting the next step in a manufacturing process.\n",
      "7.  **Prediction/Forecasting:** A broader term encompassing both classification and regression, focused on predicting future values or categories.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Relationship to Other Fields\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Machine Learning:** Data Mining heavily utilizes Machine Learning algorithms (e.g., decision trees, neural networks, support vector machines) as its core modeling tools. ML is the engine, DM is the application.\n",
      "*   **Statistics:** Data Mining builds upon statistical foundations for hypothesis testing, data distribution analysis, and model validation.\n",
      "*   **Databases:** Data Mining operates on data stored in databases and data warehouses, requiring efficient data retrieval and management.\n",
      "*   **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** Data Mining is a subfield of AI, focusing on the discovery of knowledge from data.\n",
      "*   **Big Data:** Data Mining provides the analytical tools to extract insights from the massive, complex, and diverse datasets characterized as Big Data.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Challenges in Data Mining\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Data Quality:** \"Garbage in, garbage out.\" Poor data quality can lead to misleading or incorrect insights.\n",
      "*   **Scalability:** Handling ever-increasing volumes and velocities of data.\n",
      "*   **Privacy and Ethics:** Ensuring data privacy, preventing bias in algorithms, and addressing ethical implications of using personal data.\n",
      "*   **Interpretability:** Some complex models (like deep neural networks) can be \"black boxes,\" making it hard to understand *why* they make certain predictions.\n",
      "*   **Overfitting:** Creating models that perform well on training data but poorly on new, unseen data.\n",
      "*   **Computational Cost:** The resources (CPU, memory) required for complex mining tasks can be substantial.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, Data Mining is a transformative discipline that empowers organizations and researchers to unlock the hidden potential within their data, moving beyond simple reporting to predictive analytics and prescriptive actions. It's a critical capability for innovation, competitive advantage, and informed decision-making in virtually every sector today.\n"

      "### Formal Definition\n",
      "\n",
      "**Data Mining** is the process of discovering patterns, anomalies, and useful insights from large datasets. It is an interdisciplinary field that sits at the intersection of **Statistics**, **Machine Learning**, and **Database Systems**. The ultimate goal is to transform raw data into actionable knowledge that can be used for decision-making.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's important to note that Data Mining is technically one step in a larger process called **Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD)**, but the terms are often used interchangeably.\n",
      "\n",
      "### The Core Goal: Why Do We Mine Data?\n",
      "\n",
      "The purpose of data mining isn't just to find patterns; it's to find patterns that are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Valid:** The patterns hold true on new data with a certain degree of certainty.\n",
      "2.  **Novel:** They are not obvious and were previously unknown.\n",
      "3.  **Useful:** They can be used to make a tangible business or organizational decision.\n",
      "4.  **Understandable:** The patterns can be interpreted and explained.\n",
      "\n",
      "Essentially, we mine data to answer complex questions that traditional analysis can't, such as:\n",
      "*   \"Which customers are most likely to stop using our service next month?\"\n",
      "*   \"What products are frequently purchased together?\"\n",
      "*   \"Is this credit card transaction fraudulent?\"\n",
      "*   \"Which marketing campaign will give us the highest return on investment?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### The Data Mining Process (The \"How\")\n",
      "\n",
      "Data mining is not a single event but a systematic process. The most widely accepted framework is the **CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining)**, which has six major phases:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Business Understanding:** What is the problem we are trying to solve? What are the project objectives and success criteria from a business perspective?\n",
      "2.  **Data Understanding:** Collect the initial data. Get familiar with it, identify data quality problems, and discover first insights.\n",
      "3.  **Data Preparation:** This is often the most time-consuming phase (can be up to 80% of the work!). It involves cleaning the data (handling missing values, correcting errors), integrating data from multiple sources, and transforming it into a suitable format for modeling. This is the \"sifting the dirt\" stage.\n",
      "4.  **Modeling:** This is where the core algorithms are applied. Various modeling techniques are selected and applied to the prepared data. For example, you might build a decision tree, a neural network, or a clustering model.\n",
      "5.  **Evaluation:** How good is the model we built? Does it meet the business success criteria defined in the first phase? The model is rigorously tested for accuracy and generalizability.\n",
      "6.  **Deployment:** The discovered knowledge or the validated model is put into practice. This could be a report with key insights, a new feature in an application (like a recommendation engine), or an automated fraud detection system.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Common Data Mining Tasks and Techniques (The \"What\")\n",
      "\n",
      "Data mining tasks are generally categorized into two main types:\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 1. Predictive Tasks (Supervised Learning)\n",
      "The goal is to predict a specific value based on other data attributes. The model is \"trained\" on historical data where the outcome is already known.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Classification:** Predicts a categorical label.\n",
      "    *   **Example:** Is this email `Spam` or `Not Spam`? Will a customer `Churn` or `Not Churn`?\n",
      "    *   **Algorithms:** Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Neural Networks.\n",
      "*   **Regression:** Predicts a continuous numerical value.\n",
      "    *   **Example:** What will be the `price` of this house? How many `units` will this product sell next quarter?\n",
      "    *   **Algorithms:** Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting Machines, Random Forest.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 2. Descriptive Tasks (Unsupervised Learning)\n",
      "The goal is to find interesting patterns or structures within the data without a predefined target to predict.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Clustering:** Groups similar data points together without prior knowledge of the groups.\n",
      "    *   **Example:** Segmenting customers into distinct groups (e.g., `high-spenders`, `bargain-hunters`, `new-customers`) for targeted marketing.\n",
      "    *   **Algorithms:** K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering.\n",
      "*   **Association Rule Mining:** Discovers relationships between items in a large dataset.\n",
      "    *   **Example:** The classic \"beer and diapers\" story. \"Customers who buy X are also likely to buy Y.\" This is the engine behind \"Frequently Bought Together\" on e-commerce sites.\n",
      "    *   **Algorithms:** Apriori, FP-Growth.\n",
      "*   **Anomaly Detection (Outlier Detection):** Identifies data points that are significantly different from the rest of the data.\n",
      "    *   **Example:** Detecting fraudulent credit card transactions, identifying a faulty sensor in a manufacturing line.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Data Mining vs. Data Science vs. Big Data\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Data Mining** is a core component of Data Science. It's the \"discovery\" part.\n",
      "*   **Data Science** is a broader umbrella term that includes data mining, data preparation, data visualization, software engineering, and communicating results to stakeholders.\n",
      "*   **Big Data** refers to the technological challenge of handling datasets that are so large and complex (characterized by Volume, Velocity, and Variety) that traditional data-processing application software is inadequate. Data mining techniques are often applied *to* Big Data.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, **Data Mining is the disciplined and systematic practice of using computational techniques to explore large datasets, find non-obvious patterns, and turn them into a strategic advantage.** It's the bridge between raw data and human understanding.\n",

It is an interdisciplinary field that sits at the intersection of **Statistics**, **Machine Learning**, and **Database Systems**. The ultimate goal is to transform raw data into actionable knowledge that can be used for decision-making.\n",
       "\n",
       "It's important to note that Data Mining is technically one step in a larger process called **Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD)**, but the terms are often used interchangeably.\n",
       "\n",
       "### The Core Goal: Why Do We Mine Data?\n",
       "\n",
       "The purpose of data mining isn't just to find patterns; it's to find patterns that are:\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **Valid:** The patterns hold true on new data with a certain degree of certainty.\n",
       "2.  **Novel:** They are not obvious and were previously unknown.\n",
       "3.  **Useful:** They can be used to make a tangible business or organizational decision.\n",
       "4.  **Understandable:** The patterns can be interpreted and explained.\n",
       "\n",
       "Essentially, we mine data to answer complex questions that traditional analysis can't, such as:\n",
       "*   \"Which customers are most likely to stop using our service next month?\"\n",
       "*   \"What products are frequently purchased together?\"\n",
       "*   \"Is this credit card transaction fraudulent?\"\n",

       "### The Data Mining Process (The \"How\")\n",
       "\n",
       "Data mining is not a single event but a systematic process. The most widely accepted framework is the **CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining)**, which has six major phases:\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **Business Understanding:** What is the problem we are trying to solve? What are the project objectives and success criteria from a business perspective?\n",
       "2.  **Data Understanding:** Collect the initial data. Get familiar with it, identify data quality problems, and discover first insights.\n",
       "3.  **Data Preparation:** This is often the most time-consuming phase (can be up to 80% of the work!). It involves cleaning the data (handling missing values, correcting errors), integrating data from multiple sources, and transforming it into a suitable format for modeling. This is the \"sifting the dirt\" stage.\n",
       "4.  **Modeling:** This is where the core algorithms are applied. Various modeling techniques are selected and applied to the prepared data. For example, you might build a decision tree, a neural network, or a clustering model.\n",
       "5.  **Evaluation:** How good is the model we built? Does it meet the business success criteria defined in the first phase? The model is rigorously tested for accuracy and generalizability.\n",
       "6.  **Deployment:** The discovered knowledge or the validated model is put into practice. This could be a report with key insights, a new feature in an application (like a recommendation engine), or an automated fraud detection system.\n",
       "\n",
       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "### Common Data Mining Tasks and Techniques (The \"What\")\n",
       "\n",
       "Data mining tasks are generally categorized into two main types:\n",
       "\n",
       "#### 1. Predictive Tasks (Supervised Learning)\n",
       "The goal is to predict a specific value based on other data attributes. The model is \"trained\" on historical data where the outcome is already known.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Classification:** Predicts a categorical label.\n",
       "    *   **Example:** Is this email `Spam` or `Not Spam`? Will a customer `Churn` or `Not Churn`?\n",
       "    *   **Algorithms:** Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Neural Networks.\n",
       "*   **Regression:** Predicts a continuous numerical value.\n",
       "    *   **Example:** What will be the `price` of this house? How many `units` will this product sell next quarter?\n",
       "    *   **Algorithms:** Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting Machines, Random Forest.\n",
       "\n",
       "#### 2. Descriptive Tasks (Unsupervised Learning)\n",
       "The goal is to find interesting patterns or structures within the data without a predefined target to predict.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Clustering:** Groups similar data points together without prior knowledge of the groups.\n",
       "    *   **Example:** Segmenting customers into distinct groups (e.g., `high-spenders`, `bargain-hunters`, `new-customers`) for targeted marketing.\n",
       "    *   **Algorithms:** K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering.\n",
       "*   **Association Rule Mining:** Discovers relationships between items in a large dataset.\n",
       "    *   **Example:** The classic \"beer and diapers\" story. \"Customers who buy X are also likely to buy Y.\" This is the engine behind \"Frequently Bought Together\" on e-commerce sites.\n",
       "    *   **Algorithms:** Apriori, FP-Growth.\n",
       "*   **Anomaly Detection (Outlier Detection):** Identifies data points that are significantly different from the rest of the data.\n",
       "    *   **Example:** Detecting fraudulent credit card transactions, identifying a faulty sensor in a manufacturing line.\n",
       "\n",
       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "### Data Mining vs. Data Science vs. Big Data\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Data Mining** is a core component of Data Science. It's the \"discovery\" part.\n",
       "*   **Data Science** is a broader umbrella term that includes data mining, data preparation, data visualization, software engineering, and communicating results to stakeholders.\n",
       "*   **Big Data** refers to the technological challenge of handling datasets that are so large and complex (characterized by Volume, Velocity, and Variety) that traditional data-processing application software is inadequate. Data mining techniques are often applied *to* Big Data.\n",
       "\n",
       "In summary, **Data Mining is the disciplined and systematic practice of using computational techniques to explore large datasets, find non-obvious patterns, and turn them into a strategic advantage.** It's the bridge between raw data and human understanding."

       " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nDan Baldwin\\nGroup 4\\nAuteur Review - Interstellar \\nI believe Christopher Nolan: the director behind the 2014 sci-ﬁ/adventure cinematic ‘Interstellar,’ \\nto be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent.  \\nHis style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \\nface, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \\nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \\ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \\nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \\ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \\nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \\nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \\nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \\nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \\ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \\nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \\nplanets. \\nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \\nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \\n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \\nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \\nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \\nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \\nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \\nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \\ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \\nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \\nThe imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \\nwonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \\nthem to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \\nbamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \\nwatch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \\nwill one day come true. \\nOverall, ‘Interstellar’ is a clear example of Nolan’s auteur talent, as he once again ﬁgments yet \\nanother cluster of conditions for us to marvel at. With a fantastic score from world famous \\ncomposer Hanz Zimmer, his epic, orchestral theme sets the audience in the palm of his hands as \\nwe stress over how we are all going to be saved once again.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

    "\n",
    "*   **Contextual Understanding:** Unlike older methods, LLM embeddings are contextual. The vector for a word like **\"bank\"** will be different depending on whether it's used in the context of a \"river bank\" or a \"money bank,\" providing a more nuanced representation of language.\n",

    "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where a language model combines document retrieval with text generation. In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

    "\n",
    "To make our implementation robust and efficient, we are incorporating two key features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Structured Output:** We provide the Gemini model with a specific output schema (`Emotions` class). This instructs the model to return *only* a valid emotion label (e.g., `joy`), which makes the output predictable and reliable, minimizing errors.\n",
    "2.  **API Rate Handling:** The code includes a function to manage the requests-per-minute limit of the Gemini API.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will test the model's performance on a small sample of 20 texts per emotion to ensure the process runs quickly. If the model provides an invalid response, the code will automatically retry the request until a valid classification is received.\n",

    "**Note:** You might see an `429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` error when running the following code all at once, this is because the `current API Rate Limit handling cannot reliably find out how many requests we have left per minute` from cell to cell, there is no Gemini feature created for it to get the information from their servers. So, `if you don't want to see the error you can just wait 1 minute` after one cell finished processing. But `even if there is an error showing it is fine`, internally in the code `there is a retry that happens every 15 seconds` until we finish processing our sampled data. `The lab is designed to never reach the total rate limit per day quota.`"

    "Across the three prompting setups, performance improves consistently as more examples are provided: accuracy rises from 55% (0-shot) to 57.5% (1-shot) and reaches 66.25% (5-shot), with macro F1 increasing from 0.50 → 0.55 → 0.64. Zero-shot prompting shows strong bias toward predicting anger and joy, while fear and sadness suffer from very low recall. With 1-shot prompting, predictions become more balanced, though confusion among negative emotions remains. The 5-shot setting yields the most stable and accurate results, substantially improving anger and sadness classification while further strengthening joy. However, fear remains the most challenging class across all settings, showing limited recall improvements. Overall, providing more in-context examples helps the model establish clearer class boundaries and significantly enhances classification performance."

    "**Case Study:** Check the results' files inside the `results/llm_classification_results` directory and find cases where the **text classification improves with more examples** (pred emotion is right with examples), **cases where it does not improve** (pred emotion always wrong) and **cases where the classification got worse with more examples** (pred emotion goes from right to wrong with examples). For this you need to load the results with pandas and handle the data using its dataframe functions. Discuss about the findings."

    "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
