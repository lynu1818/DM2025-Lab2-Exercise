The `first two phases` refer to the `exercises inside the Master notebooks` of the [DM2025-Lab2-Exercise Repo](https://github.com/difersalest/DM2025-Lab2-Exercise.git). The `third phase` refers to an `internal Kaggle competition` that we are gonna run among all the Data Mining students. Together they add up to `100 points` of your grade. There are also some `bonus points` to be gained if you complete `extra exercises` in the lab **(bonus 15 pts)** and in the `Kaggle Competition report` **(bonus 5 pts)**.\n",

    "- **Phase 1 exercises:** Need GPU for training the models explained in that part, if you don't have a GPU in your laptop it is recommended to run in Colab or Kaggle for a faster experience, although with CPU they can still be solved but with a slower execution.\n",
    "- **Phase 2 exercises:** We use Gemini's API so everything can be run with only CPU without a problem.\n",
    "- **Phase 3 exercises:** For the competition you will probably need GPU to train your models, so it is recommended to use Colab or Kaggle if you don't have a laptop with a dedicated GPU.\n",
    "- **Optional Ollama Notebook (not graded):** You need GPU, at least 4GB of VRAM with 16 GB of RAM to run the local open-source LLM models. \n",

    "### 1.1 Preprocessing Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Text Cleaning**:\n",
    "   - Converted all text to **lowercase** for consistency\n",
    "   - **Removed URLs** (they don't contain emotion information)\n",
    "   - **Kept emojis** - crucial for emotion detection (e.g., 😊, 😢, 😡)\n",
    "   - **Kept punctuation** - exclamation marks (!) and question marks (?) are strong emotional signals\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Hashtag Integration**:\n",
    "   - Added hashtags from the JSON field directly to text (e.g., #happy, #sad)\n",
    "   - 5.2% of posts had hashtags that provide explicit emotional labels\n",
    "   - Example: \"I'm SO HAPPY!!!\" + [\"joy\"] → \"i'm so happy!!! #joy\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Space Normalization**:\n",
    "   - Removed excessive whitespace while preserving single spaces between words\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Feature Engineering Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "I used a Deep Learning approach with pre-trained transformer models, which minimizes manual feature engineering:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tokenization with Pre-trained Tokenizers**:\n",
    "   - Used model-specific tokenizers (BERT, RoBERTa, BERTweet)\n",
    "   - **Max sequence length: 128 tokens** (covers 95%+ of texts in dataset)\n",
    "   - Dynamic padding for efficient batch processing\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Implicit Features Learned by Transformers**:\n",
    "   - Contextual word embeddings (768-dimensional vectors)\n",
    "   - Attention mechanisms capture emotional patterns and word relationships\n",
    "   - Position-aware representations\n",
    "   - Sub-word tokenization handles rare words and social media slang\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Explanation of Your Model\n",
    "\n",
    "**Architecture Selection: Deep Learning vs Traditional ML**\n",
    "\n",
    "After consulting with ChatGPT and running preliminary experiments, I chose Deep Learning over traditional ML approaches (SVM, Random Forest) because:\n",
    "- Transformers excel at understanding contextual nuances in emotion\n",
    "- Pre-trained models have learned linguistic patterns from billions of words\n",

    "**Ensemble Method - Soft Voting**\n",
    "- Combined all three models using **probability averaging**\n",
    "- Each model generates probability distribution over 6 emotions\n",

    "- **Public Score: 0.6964** (Best result!)\n",

    "**Ensemble Performance**:\n",
    "- Improved over best single model by ~1.2%\n",
    "- Agreement between models: 81-84%\n",
    "- Ensemble confidence: mean 0.74, highest on \"joy\" (0.83), lowest on \"disgust\" (0.44)\n",

    "### 2.2 Insights I Gained\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pre-trained Model Selection Matters**\n",
    "- BERTweet (Twitter-trained) performed well due to domain similarity\n",
    "- Model diversity in ensemble is more valuable than just using multiple checkpoints of the same model\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ensemble Benefits**\n",
    "- The ensemble outperforms each of the three individual models\n",
    "\n",
    "**Class Imbalance Impact**\n",
    "- Joy (50% of data) dominates predictions - models tend to predict it more\n",
