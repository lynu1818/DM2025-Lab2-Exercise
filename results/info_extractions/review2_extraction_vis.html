Film Review: Foxcatcher
Posted On : November 17, 2014 Published By : Terence Johnson
Foxcatcher is <span class="lx-highlight lx-current-highlight" data-idx="0" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">not an easy movie to sit through</span>. In fact it’s <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="1" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">quite unpleasant</span>, 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="2" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">oppressively intense from the start of the movie</span>, and by the time the movie is over, 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="3" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">you’ll feel as if all your joy and life has been sucked from you</span>. You’ll also be 
hankering to see it again as Foxcatcher is also <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="4" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">one of the finest films of the year</span>.
When we arrive at the beginning of our tale, Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum) has been 
stuck in a malaise. A former Olympic gold medalist, he’s now spending time doing 
visits to schools, eating ramen with hot sauce in a sparse apartment and training with 
his brother Dave Schultz (Mark Ruffalo). His life gets a bit of an injection when he is 
courted by millionaire John du Pont (Steve Carell) to come train at his home and help 
build an Olympic team. What seems like an ideal set up (unlimited resources, his own 
house, helping craft a team) slowly erodes into <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="5" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">a tense mixture of shattered dreams, 
psychological issues and despair</span>.
I don’t know how to properly talk about this film as <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="6" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">my soul has yet to recover from 
the movie</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="7" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Watching Foxcatcher is like having your heart put into a vice grip for two 
hours and fifteen minutes</span>. Bennett Miller paints such <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="8" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">a bleak and unrelenting picture 
of psychosis, machismo and darkness</span> that <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="9" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">in the happy moments you’ll be gasping 
for air</span>. This isn’t to say the movie is too dark to enjoy as I found myself <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="10" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;"><span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="11" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">captivated by 
every character beat the movie hit</span> and the journey the film took me on</span>, just that Miller 
wants you to feel the weight of the proceedings. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="12" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">You feel as tired as Dave or Mark 
Shultz after a training match</span> or <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="13" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">as put upon as John du Pont by the time the movie is 
over</span>. Miller, who dazzled with Capote and Moneyball, takes yet another step in his 
career at crafting <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="14" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">incredibly thorough character study</span>. I remarked after the film that 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="15" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the film feels so claustrophobic without being forcefully so</span>. There are so many scenes 
that standout in this regard, and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="16" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Miller is a director unafraid to let the moment be</span>. 
Take for instance the introduction to the brothers via a brutally almost silent sparring 
match or a shot near the end of the film with du Pont jogging around the Foxcatcher 
gym, Miller, along with his DP Greg Fraiser and composer Rob Simonsen, are just 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="17" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">masterful</span>. There’s never a point during this film where <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="18" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">you don’t feel like you’re 
in the hands of a sterling creative team</span> and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="19" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the daunting tale still has a visual might</span>.
Of course <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="20" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">it’s easy to craft engaging scenes when you are working with an airtight 
script</span>. E. Max Frye and Dan Futterman have set up <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="21" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">an incredibly fascinating chamber 
piece and character study</span> with Foxcatcher. The movie has a lot to accomplish both 
thematically and plot wise, and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="22" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">these two writers manage to find a really great</span>
&quot;&quot;&quot;

**Page 2**
&quot;&quot;&quot;
balance between two. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="23" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">This movie has so much to say and does so without stopping 
for speeches or twisting the narrative to those whims</span>. There’s so much to dive into 
with this film regarding the athlete’s psyche, the drive for excellence, and the blurred 
lines between brotherhood/mentorship with regards to Mark/Dave/John and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="24" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the 
movie finds interesting ways to do this</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="25" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Foxcatcher is really a feat</span> considering that its a 
bleak movie where the characters don’t achieve their goals and yet <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="26" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">you never get 
depressed</span>. Most surprising to me is <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="27" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">how effortlessly the script moves through time</span> 
(the movie covers about 10 years) without any issue.
While <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="28" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">everything in the film works</span>, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="29" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Foxcatcher wouldn’t have reached the incredible 
heights it does without a phenomenal trio of performances at it’s center</span>. To be asked 
to pick out a best in show is <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="30" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">impossible given what each man has to offer</span>. As the 
brother, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="31" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Mark Ruffalo continues to find new ways to explore natural humanity</span>. His role 
is <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="32" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">much less showy than the other two</span> and yet <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="33" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">you never lose him on screen</span> and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="34" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">he 
makes the brotherly bond feel real from the first moment on screen</span>. Speaking of 
things working from the first moment, Steve Carell, my word, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="35" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">what a performance</span>. 
Every time he’s on screen there’s <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="36" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">a sense of palpable dread and unease</span>, which is 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="37" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">amazing given his character’s pitifulness and lack of physical imposing-ness</span>. Much 
will be made of the prosthetic nose he has to wear but <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="38" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Carell’s chilling performance 
is so much more than a physical trait</span>, he gets into this character’s head. What he 
found there is hard for me to say, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="39" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">you never truly find out du Pont’s motivations</span>, but 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="40" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Carell isn’t here to make his character easily explainable</span>. The final piece of the 
puzzle is Channing Tatum, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="41" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">an actor who finally seems to be realizing his potential</span>. 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="42" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Mark is a character someone like Channing should be playing at this stage in his career</span> 
and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="43" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">he does the most with the part</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="44" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">He uses every ounce of his physicality with this 
role as a wrestler</span> but <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="45" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">it’s the psychology of this character that he lets pour through 
the screen</span>, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="46" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">channeling the character’s inner turmoil and fraying mental state as well 
as the physical</span>.
Foxcatcher is a movie that <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="47" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">shows the worst of us</span> while being <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="48" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">one of the best films of 
the year</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="49" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">You owe it to yourself to run to check it out</span>.
