Okay, so in data preprocessing, we have so many different uh the different way that you can working on. So one possible way for you to working on is called aggregation.

[SLIDE DESCRIPTION]
Aggregation
- Combining two or more attributes (or objects) into a single attribute (or object)
- Purpose
  - Data reduction
  - Reduce the number of attributes or objects
  - Change of scale
  - Cities aggregated into regions, states, countries, etc

[TRANSCRIPT - 149:37]
Aggregation is you can somehow combine two or more attributes or objects into a single attribute or object value. Or you can combine two or more objects into a single one. So for example, right here, the department name and their average salary. So this average salary right here is an aggregation. Why? Because I don't get every individual salary. I got a mean salary. Because first we reduce the data. So reduce your data size. So if you have 100 people, by doing this aggregation, you only get one value. So reduce your data size. Second, it changed the scale. For example, today you are not average. You change that to sum or counts. The scale will be changed. And sometimes you have this individual, for example, students care about GPA. What is the GPA? You have so many records about different course, different score from them. And then they just average them and become one value. So you change your scale. And most of the time, those aggregation will give you a more stable data. In other words, if you have a lot of noise, having aggregation data will somehow move the noise a little bit. Because you can imagine if you have value right here, you probably have noise right this far. You might also have noise right here. They will actually be surrounding by different place. So when you average them, it looks like all the noise actually will be tested out. So then you will become the center part is more important.
